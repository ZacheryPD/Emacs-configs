#+TITLE: Readme first
* What is this

  I have decided to roll my own [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] config. Why? Because I enjoy
  spending an inordinate amount of time on things that don't
  matter. It is heavily based on [[https://www.spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs.]]

* Setting up

  Just clone this into your emacs config folder!

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    git clone git@github.com:zach-delong/Emacs-configs.git ~/.emacs.d
  #+END_SRC

* Where is the config?

  When emacs starts, one of the main things it looks for is a folder
  ~.emacs.d/~. If there is a file called ~init.el~ in that folder,
  then it will automatically load that.

  If you open that file, you'll find shockingly little. Instead, look
  at the first line, tangles the config code out of the org mode file
  ~config.org~ using [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][Org-Babel]]. If those words don't make sense, don't
  worry, it all works.  Probably. 

  For an explanation of how all this works, start by reading [[file:config.org::*What is this?][config.org]].
  That file, apart from containing the actual code, also has an
  explanation of what/why.

  You also might want to look at the ~early-init.el~ file. [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Early-Init-File.html][Emacs loads
  this file before loading the package system and long before loading]]
  ~init.el~, so there are some things in there to speed up startup and
  configure things before the main init file loads.
