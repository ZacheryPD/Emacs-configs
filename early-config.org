* Early Init

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Early-Init-File.html][This file is loaded way before the normal config file]]. As such, I am
using it to set certain things that I like to have set but which can
be slow or need to be configured before all packages are loaded. 

** Visual customizations

It's slightly faster to customize the UI before it's actually
loaded. This can also help prevent the UI from "flickering" as things
that I don't really need are disabled. That flickering was happening
before I moved into the ~early-init.el~ model.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle early-config.el
     (tool-bar-mode -1) ; There are "shortcut" tools I don't really use
     (menu-bar-mode -1) ; The File, Edit, etc. menues that I don't use
     (scroll-bar-mode -1) ; The scroll bars are just kind of bad looking
			  ; in my opinion
     (pixel-scroll-mode 1)
   #+END_SRC
